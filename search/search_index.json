The bootstrap container then starts all services required to run offensity as separate docker containers and performs migrations. These service containers are managed by the bootstrap container, not by docker-compose. The scans are performed by the Offensity runner, which runs scanmodules. Each scanmodule runs in it's own separate docker container. The bootstrap container regularly checks for updates in the background. When updates are available, the new version is downloaded and applied. During the update process, all services are restarted and migrations are performed. This results in a short downtime. During updates no scans are cancelled and no scandata is lost. Network Access All docker containers run in a separate docker network ( offensity-net ). Only the reporting web interface is published to 127.0.0.1:8080. When the Offensity web interface should be accessible from other hosts over the network, a reverse proxy should be configured in front of it. Configuration During the first run, a settings.yml file is created in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file, which contains initial configurations for all services. Everything should be able to run without further configurations. Nevertheless, settings.yml can be edited manually to modify service configurations. Changes in settings will not be overwritten, but updates might introduce additional settings and write to that file. Note that, when settings.yml is updated, comments will be stripped.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#introduction","text":"The bootstrap container is started with docker-compose (see docker-compose.yml ).
